# typegraphql-playground

This is a learning playground, messing around with `type-graphql`. I am mostly following [Ben Awad's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN3n1USn4xlma1bBu3Tloe4NyYn9Ko8Gs), but updating for Apollo Server 3.x and `type-graphql` 1.x as I go since his guide is 2+ years old.
